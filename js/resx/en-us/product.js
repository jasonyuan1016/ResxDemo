    "test_long_text":"<p>On October 31st, the Ministry of Commerce held a regular press conference, and the following is a partial transcript of the text</ p> CNBC reporter: The European Commission has announced its decision to impose a final five-year countervailing duty on electric vehicles imported from China, with the announced tariffs decreasing in July. What is China's response to this? Meanwhile, there are reports suggesting that Chinese car companies suspend their business expansion and investment plans in Europe. May I ask if the Ministry of Commerce can verify</ p> Spokesperson He Yadong: Regarding the first question. There are many unreasonable and non compliant practices by the European side in the investigation of anti subsidy for electric vehicles in China. The Chinese side has always raised a comprehensive defense and submitted a large number of comments and evidence materials to the European side, but the European side has not fully considered them. We have noticed that the tax rate level in the final ruling has been adjusted compared to the initial ruling in July, but the European side has not fundamentally changed its erroneous approach. The ruling does not comply with WTO rules and fails to address the core concerns of the Chinese and European industries. China does not agree or accept this</ p> Regarding the second question. China has always supported and encouraged the normal economic, trade, and investment cooperation between China and Europe in the automotive industry, which is mutually beneficial and win-win. China always adheres to an open and cooperative attitude, insists on market leadership, relies on full competition, and cooperates with relevant countries in the electric vehicle industry through various means such as trade, investment, and technology to jointly maintain the stability of the global automotive industry chain and supply chain, and is committed to green and low-carbon transformation and jointly addressing climate change</ p>"
